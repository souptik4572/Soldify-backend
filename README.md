## Local Usage

### 1. Install
This uses Python3, so firstly please install python3

- Firstly we need to clone this repository and open cmd/bash at this folder

- Now we will also need some other python packages as dependencies. So it will be better if we create an exclusive virtual environment for installing these dependencies
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
- Next we need to create a virtual environment and activate it on our current console
```bash
virtualenv env_name
```
Under mac operating system
```bash
source env_name/bin/activate
```
Under windows operating system
```bash
env_name\Scripts\activate
```
- Next we continue installing all the necessary dependencies using the requirements.txt file
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Finally we can start our local server by running the following command and it will accessed at http://localhost:5000
```bash
python app.py
```
